# Distributed Systems

## Overview

This repository contains my coursework, assignments, and personal implementations for the **Distributed Systems** course at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, for the academic year 2024/2025. It serves as a collection of my work from lectures, lab exercises, and homework, covering various aspects of distributed computing.

The repository includes code samples, project solutions, and practical exercises related to topics such as network communication, microservices, distributed databases, and consensus algorithms. It is intended for learning, experimentation, and tracking my progress in the subject.
